Cloudly
=======

We use a lot of cloud stuff here at OODA Technologies. This library contains
all sort of small helper modules from quickly launching an EC2 instance and
configuring it according to our taste to wrappers around pub/sub providers, to
easy connection to a CouchDB.

Currently, this includes wrappers, tools and utilities like:

 - AWS
 - Redis
 - Redis queues using [RQ](http://python-rq.org/)
 - CouchDB
 - decorators
 - metrics using [Cube](http://square.github.com/cube/)
 - logging
 - notification using SNS
 - publish/subscribe using [PubNub](http://www.pubnub.com/) or
   [Pusher](http://pusher.com/)
