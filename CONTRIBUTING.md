Guidelines for contributing
===========================

Here are some guidelines for contributing new features, fixing bugs and overall
adding new code to this project.


Pull request checklist
----------------------
For the impatient:

 1. Make sure it's PEP8 compliant.
 3. Rebase onto master.
 4. Open a pull request on GitHub.


Coding style guides
-------------------

### Python
You should closely follow the PEP8 style guide described
[here](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). However, the best way to
ensure your code is compliant is to use a tool that automatically checks your
code, like *pep8.py*. See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/q/399956) for hints
on how to do that.


Versioning
----------

We use the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) scheme. The master branch
should be tagged appropriately.
